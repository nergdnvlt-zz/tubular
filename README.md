# README

This is a quick application to analyze the recommendation of Tubing Conditions in Boulder, CO.

It is built with Ruby/Rails and consumes an external API hosted on heroku.

There isn't any styling as the main focus was the feature of getting information from the external API, then making a recommendation based on that information.
